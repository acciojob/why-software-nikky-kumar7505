		Why I want to become a developer?
	</h1>
	<p>
		I want to become a web developer because I enjoy building things that people can use and interact with. I find it exciting that with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I can bring ideas to life in the browser. I’ve already built a few small projects, and every time I see them working, it motivates me to learn more.

Web development also offers a perfect mix of creativity and logic, and I love that balance. Plus, it's always evolving, so there's always something new to learn — and that keeps me motivated to keep growing in this field.
